        <p class="odd">A central processing unit (CPU), also called a central processor,
         main processor, or just processor, is the most important processor in a given 
         computer. Its electronic circuitry executes instructions of a computer program,
          such as arithmetic, logic, controlling, and input output operations.
           This role contrasts with that of external components, such as main memory and 
           circuitry, and specialized coprocessors such as graphics processing units (GPUs).
           </p>

        <p>
            A graphics processing unit is a specialized electronic circuit initially designed
             for digital image processing and to accelerate computer graphics, being present
              either as a discrete video card or embedded on motherboards, mobile phones,
               personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.
       </p>

       <p class="odd">
        In a computer system, the motherboard is a main printed circuit. It is also called the main
         circuit board or mainboard. It includes several components on a single platform. It allows
          communication between the RAM, ROM, hard drive, and other computer hardware components.
           The motherboard is also called the backbone of a computer. 
   </p>

   <p>
    So now, we know that those sticks in your PC's motherboard are system RAM, and they
     function as short-term memory, but what does that all mean in practice? Well, when
      you carry out actions on your computer, like opening a text document, it requires
       access to the data contained in that file. When you're not working on that document
        or you click save, the latest copy of that file is saved to the hard drive in
         long-term storage.
</p>

<p class="odd">
    Data storage is the collective methods and technologies that capture and retain digital
     information on electromagnetic, optical or silicon-based storage media. Storage is used
      in offices, data centers, edge environments, remote locations and people's homes.
       Storage is also an important component in mobile devices such as smartphones and
        tablets. Consumers and businesses rely on storage to preserve information ranging
         from personal photos to business-critical data.
